# UFOs
## Overview of Project
In this project a Javascript is created with various features to search up UFO sighting dates, cities, states, countries, and shapes. Multiple filters are also created so that the table data can be filtered by users of the web page. JavaScript is used to load an array of table rows into the HTML web page table through given data.js file. CSS and Bootstrap are used to design and feature the website.

## Summary
While working on this project, there were some drawbacks that needs attention for improving the website:
- Adding real time feature in the search box. It would provide greater detail for people who are searching for time period.
- Specifying the time duration of the siting to be more accurate.
